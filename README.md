(IN PROGRESS)

This repository contains custom Python scripts, plots, and batch scripts for linearly downscaling climate data.

**Directories**:
  
 * *pythonScripts* - A folder to store scripts called by bash scripts
    * *gen_time_series.py* - A Python file to downscale date using existing betas
    * *regress.py* - Optimizable Python file to do regression for downscaling
    * *regression_methods.py* - A module of functions to perform the necessary steps for downscaling
    * *plotting.py* - A module of plotting functions for the modeled data
    * *settings.txt* - Settings for regress.py
    * *helperScripts/* - A folder of other non-essential scripts
    * *txt_files* - a folder csv files

 * *bashScripts/* - Contains batch scripts for submission to the NCAR supercomputer
    * *gen_time_series.sh* -- A script to generate time series from existing betas
    * *regress_OLS.sh* -- A script to run regression, save betas, save predictions, and generate plots

 * *SDSM_p1/* - Plots and raw data from running SDSM for daily maximum temperature on p1 (lat = 38.125, lon = -101.875) with variance inflation = 1
    * *plots/*
      * *Compare* - A few plots comparing the Python output to SDSM output for predictions  
      * *SDSM/* - Plots of just the SDSM output
    * *betas_python.txt* - the coefficients generated by the python program
    * *betas.txt* - the coefficients generated by SDSM (a txt version of the PAR file)
    * *tmax_p1_output.OUT* - SDSM OUT file of weather generation (variance inflation = 1)
    * *tmax_p1_output.SIM* - SDSM metadata file
    * *tmax_p1.PAR* - SDSM PAR file of betas
